# Nitrogen Configuration
# Copy this file to ~/.config/nitrogen/config.toml

# All settings here serve as defaults. They can be overridden via CLI arguments.
# For example: nitrogen cast --preset 720p60 --codec hevc

[defaults]
# Output preset determines resolution and framerate
# Options: 720p30, 720p60, 1080p30, 1080p60, 1440p30, 1440p60, 1440p120, 4k30, 4k60, 4k120

# Video codec for encoding
# Options:
#   h264 - Most compatible, works everywhere (recommended)
#   hevc - Better compression, newer applications
#   av1  - Best compression, requires RTX 40-series or newer
codec = "h264"

# Target bitrate in kbps
# Set to 0 for automatic bitrate based on preset
# Suggested values:
#   720p30:  2500 kbps    720p60:  4000 kbps
#   1080p30: 4500 kbps    1080p60: 6000 kbps
#   1440p60: 12000 kbps   4k60:    25000 kbps

# Low-latency mode optimizes for minimal delay
# Recommended for Discord and real-time streaming
# Disable for better quality if latency isn't critical

[encoder]
# Encoder quality preset
# Options:
#   fast    - Fastest encoding, lowest quality
#   medium  - Balanced speed and quality (recommended)
#   slow    - Slower encoding, better quality
#   quality - Best quality, slowest encoding

# GPU index to use for encoding (0 = first GPU)
# Use nvidia-smi to list available GPUs

[camera]
# Virtual camera name shown in applications like Discord, OBS, etc.
# This is how your virtual camera will appear in application camera lists
